We went down to the chicken coop early again this morning, we even had to drag Pappa out of bed (again)

Still no eggs from our little ladies. DJ was first out of the roost and went straight down to breakfast. Luckily their water had not frozen in the night again. DJ also found a worm.

Above is a picture I took of Fudge on my camera. Fudge loves to eat my hair. ðŸ˜Š
